# **Sundial**

### Created by Jen Brissman, Ilana Rose Mercer, Rachel Perkins, Yvonne Yeh (A.K.A. **The Lovalace Ladies**)

_Sundial_ is a web app for yoga enthusiasts that allows practitioners (teachers and students) to algorithmically generate yoga sequences at the touch of a button. Users can generate and save these sequences to use for both teaching and personal, at-home use.:sun_with_face:

## **Tech Stack**

**Front-end**: React, CSS, HTML </br>
**Back-end**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, CockroachDB </br>
**APIs**: Yoga API by Rebecca G. Estes with expanded data set from the creators and friendly yoga teachers

## About the project

One of the most difficult parts of being a good yoga teacher is planning out effective yoga sequences that take into account the transitions between poses. Teachers also require deep understanding of the body, anatomy, and flow of positions when creating the sequences. An experienced registered yoga teacher, Yvonne proposed an app that plans out yoga sequences to her Hackathon team, the Lovelace Ladies. We are all passionate about mental health and wellness, and together we built Sundial.
