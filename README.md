## About the project


Yvonne was initially inspired to create such an app long ago while working as a yoga instructor, and her proposal was supported by our whole group (the Lovelace Ladies) as a way to provide a free, easy way to create yoga sequences. Yoga is an essential tool for the mental and physical health of many, and we felt that it was important for anyone to have free access to these sequences, and the ability to start customizing one's own personal health care.
