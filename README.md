# **Sundial**
Created by **The Lovelace Ladies**: Jen Brissman, Ilana Rose Mercer, Rachel Perkins, Yvonne Yeh

*Sundial* is a web app for yoga students, teachers, and enthusiasts that allows a user to create custom yoga sequences. Users can also generate random sequences of varying lengths, and save all sequences to their yoga library. 

_Sundial_ is a web app for yoga enthusiasts that allows practitioners (teachers and students) to algorithmically generate yoga sequences at the touch of a button. Users can generate and save these sequences to use for both teaching and personal, at-home use.:sun_with_face:

## **Tech Stack**

**Front-end**: React, CSS, HTML </br>
**Back-end**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, CockroachDB </br>
**APIs**: Yoga API by Rebecca G. Estes with expanded data set from the creators and friendly yoga teachers

## About the project

One of the most difficult parts of being a good yoga teacher is planning out effective yoga sequences that take into account the transitions between poses. Teachers also require deep understanding of the body, anatomy, and flow of positions when creating the sequences. An experienced registered yoga teacher, Yvonne proposed an app that plans out yoga sequences to her Hackathon team, the Lovelace Ladies. We are all passionate about mental health and wellness, and together we built Sundial.

## **Setup/Installation**

#### **Requirements**

- CockroachDB
- Python 3.7.3


## **Tech Stack**
**Front-end**: React, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML </br>
**Back-end**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, CockroachDB </br>
**APIs**: Yoga API by Rebecca G. Estes with expanded data set from the creators and generous yoga teachers


## Inspiration
Yoga is an essential tool for the mental and physical health of many, and we felt that it was important for anyone to have free access to these sequences, and the ability to start customizing one's own personal health care. 

This app was inspired by Yvonne's background as a yoga teacher. She and her yoga teacher friends love sequencing classes but often it take a long time to plan out series of classes. She brought this idea to her Hackathon team, the Lovelace Ladies, all passionate about mental health and wellness -- and together they built **Sundial**.


## How we built it
Working together remotely, we are a team of 4 based out of New York, Florida, Oregon, and California. To navigate this, we used Git/GitHub for version control and VS Code Live Share to pair program.


## Challenges we ran into
Understanding React took some trial and error, especially since Rachel was the only member of the team with experience using React. This was the first time for all of us using CockroachDB, we ran into issues seeding the initial database, but after debugging one line at a time we were able to figure it how to load our database in.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built a custom yoga sequence generator by inputting real yoga sequences created by Yvonne. Using this seed data, we populated a dictionary of Markov chains to create an algorithm that procedurally generates new yoga sequences.

## What we learned
We learned that being ambitious with our MVP can lead to some incredible learning experiences. Seeing a project built from scratch to completion was rewarding! We learned how important understanding our data model is, as it allows the whole team to be in agreement about how to build features that layer on top of each other.

## What's next for Sundial
- Additional poses in our yoga API and more base sequences to make the algorithmically generated sequences more diverse
- More options for generating sequences (length, difficulty, target poses)
- Connecting Spotify API to link music to playlists
- Share sequences with other members
- Incorporate Twilio API to send sequences via text or email
